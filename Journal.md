I finished problem 1 through 5 in the work session. The first 4 questions are quite successful and problem five is kind of a roadblock to me. At first I iterate from 20 to 1, if the product cannot be divided by the number, then I time the number. However, I realized there is a problem of redundant prime factors, Therefore, I chose to count the number of each prime factor with a dictionary.

I finished problem 6 through 10 in this work session. Most of the questions focuses on prime. I just used the same method to find prime numbers on every one of them. The roadblock is on #8 when there is a long integer for input and I needed to iterate over every digit of it. Finally I came up with the idea to take it as a string which made the iteration much easier.

I finished problem 12 throught 18 except 17 and 14 because of input issues. The main obstacle I face is problem 18. The other problems can be solved trickfully with strings in python and long int type in python. However, problem 18 requires some dynamic programming and needs to store a tree. I have problems storing trees in python; therefore I decided to use c++. Then, it is rather easy. Just make a matrix that stores the max of sum on every point of the triangle and find the greatest one.
