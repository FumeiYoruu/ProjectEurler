I finished problem 1 through 5 in the work session. The first 4 questions are quite successful and problem five is kind of a roadblock to me. At first I iterate from 20 to 1, if the product cannot be divided by the number, then I time the number. However, I realized there is a problem of redundant prime factors, Therefore, I chose to count the number of each prime factor with a dictionary.
